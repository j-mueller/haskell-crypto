<<: *version
synopsis: Streaming for crypto-sodium
description: |
  __Note: this package is experimental and WIP.__

  @crypto-sodium@ provides a high-level cryptography API.
  Some of the functions that it implements work with data that can be large.
  In order to work with it efficiently, it provides versions of those functions
  that can work on lazy byte strings.

  This library expand support for lazy data further by providing a streaming
  interface. We chose @streamly@ as the streaming library for this purpose, as
  we found it to be the most advanced and well-thought one of all. The good news
  is that most other streams can be easily converted to @streamly@, so you donâ€™t
  miss out, no matter which library you decide to use in your project.
